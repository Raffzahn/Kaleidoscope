# Kaleidoscope
Commented Disassembly of  Li-Chen Wang's classic Kaleidoscope program for the Cromemco Dazzler

---

## What is/was Kaleidoscope

[Kaleidoscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li-Chen_Wang#Cromemco) is a rather tiny (127 Bytes) demo program for the [Cromemco Dazzler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cromemco_Dazzler) by [Li-Chen Wang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li-Chen_Wang). It displays a 64x64 colour graphic much like a mechanical [kaleidoscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaleidoscope) using the repetitive structure of the Dazzlers memroy. The program was sold by Cromemco as on it's own for 15 USD on paper tape or later on floppy disk as part of their _DAZZLER Games_ pack at 95 USD.

## Why Adding a Repository 40+ Years Later?

In early October 2022 Maury Markowitz [asked](https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/25304) on [RetroComputing.SE](https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/) if there's some high level analysis for that program, as all he could find was a basic disassembly. There are many sites referencing Kaleidoscope, including a few [running some emulation](https://observablehq.com/@fil/kaleidoscope-1976) to show it's output, but none offering a commented source or high level description - the only one [attempting to do so](https://www.quaxio.com/kaleidoscope_part1/) in 2020 [closed his blog](https://www.quaxio.com/last_post/) right before touching that part :(

Being curious (and a bit bored) I decided to take a look at the disassembly, resulting in what's found here.
